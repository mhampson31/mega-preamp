# mega-preamp
This program controls my Arduino Mega-based DIY audio receiver.

The Mega coordinates a few other hardware components: 
 * several relay pairs used to select input and output channels
 * an OLED display
 * a motorized volume control potentiometer
 * a hardware power button
 * an IR receiver for remote control
 * a real-time clock
